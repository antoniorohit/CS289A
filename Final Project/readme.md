*Real-Time Gender Classifier Based on Voice*

*Introduction*
This project documents a real-time gender classifier based on voice, developed as the final project for CS289A Introduction to Machine Learning (Spring 2015) at UC Berkeley.

The project uses a Random Forest classifier and MFCC+pitch features. A simplistic adaptive energy detection method is used to remove silence. It achieves >90% accuracy on a custom dataset, and has been tested on the voxforge dataset with good results as well. For more details on the implementation and tests, please read the report *Real Time Gender Identifier Based on Voice.pdf*
